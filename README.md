 This software is targeted to be used in pet shops, where pets are sold and bought such as
 dogs, cats, birds, fishes etc. Shop owners will use the software to keep track of his/her
 inventory and check sale/purchase details to understand profit/loss of his/her business.

 database upfront. Registration feature is not needed.
 Features:

 pet is. Shop owner can add, update, delete item from this list using id.
